# Ae.aegypti-toolset

A set of scripts to help with Ae.aegypti genomic analyses. On the wishlist:

* In silico genomic sexing based on Fontaine et al. (2016) http://dx.doi.org/10.1101/060061
* Convert VCF file mapped to supercontigs to VCF file mapped to Juneja chromosomes
* Convert PLINK output files mapped to supercontigs to mapping to Juneja chromosomes - Then potentially use as input to SNeP -> https://sourceforge.net/projects/snepnetrends/?source=navbar http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fgene.2015.00109
* R mapping superconts to Juneja chromosomes script
* R LD visualisation Shiny app
